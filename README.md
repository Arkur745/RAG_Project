3. **Upload a PDF** and start chatting!

## üí° How It Works

- **Upload:** The PDF is loaded and split into chunks.
- **Embed:** Chunks are embedded using HuggingFace models and stored in ChromaDB.
- **Ask:** Your question (and chat history) is used to reformulate ambiguous queries.
- **Retrieve:** The most relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector store.
- **Answer:** The LLM answers your question, grounded in the document content.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security

**Never commit your `.env` file or any file containing API keys.**  
Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` and share a `.env.example` with placeholder values.
